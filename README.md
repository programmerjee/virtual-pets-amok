# virtual-pets-amok
In this project, I have created more organization for my pet shelter.  I have virtual and organic pets with different needs and methods.
Virtual robotic pets need to be oiled regularly and organic pets need to be cleaned, watered, and fed regularly.
Organic dogs need to be walked regularly (this will help their hygiene).
The cat litter box needs to be cleaned regularly (this will help their hygiene).

Health drops if happiness, hygiene, hydration, or feed levels drop too low.
